        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Aditya Bhardwaj, a dedicated and passionate Electronic and communication student at Centurion University. Currently in my final year, I am focusing on Data science and Machine Learning.</p>
        <p>My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in technology and innovation, which has led me to work on various projects such as developing a mobile app for campus navigation. I am skilled in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, and I am always eager to learn more and take on new challenges.</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing the Guitar and participating in Events, which help me stay balanced and inspired. My future aspirations include working in the tech industry as a Data scientist engineer and contributing to open-source projects.</p>
        <p>A fun fact about me: I can solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute!</p>
